# STYSL.github.io
This site was initially created about 2 years ago as a final website project for an HTML/CSS/JavaScript class .
I decided to use github as a webhost since the service is free.
The goal while building the site was to self-code everything myself and feature personal content as way to showcase
not only web development skills but also digital media production skills.
I included comments within my coding to explain my thought-process and intentions.
Some graphics and links to audio files throughout the site might still display or refer to "STISL", which was changed to "STYSL" after launch of site.
Updating all files referenced to say "STYSL" is still in the process.
However, I have ensured that the HTML structure and navigation of the site still functions.
Regarding navigation, I wanted to have a hamburger menu that opens up the navigation list only when clicked.
I decided to use the "Iceberg" font througout for design consistency.
I used Javascript to make thumbnails with id seclectors and onclick event listener attitibutes for graphic, music, and video elements
that would reveal larger displays of themselves.
Because Github does not allow server-side scripts and programs to run on the back end of their servers (unless I'm mistaken),
I used Repl.it to upload and run Python and C++ files I also completed for some programming classes.
These types of repositories and others of mine are also viewable.
Thank you for any feedback!

V/r,

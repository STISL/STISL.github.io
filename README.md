# STYSL.github.io
This site was initially created about 2 years ago as a final website project for an HTML/CSS/JavaScript class.
I decided to use github as a webhost since the service is free.
The goal while building the site was to self-code everything myself and feature personal content as way to also showcase some digital media production skills
along with web development skills.
I included comments within my coding to explain my thought-process and intentions.
Because I've changed the titles of some of my creative works, some links might be broken and names of things and graphics not match.
However, I have ensured that the HTML structure and navigation of the site still functions.
Regarding navigation, I wanted to have a hamburger menu that opens up the list only when clicked.
I decided to use the "Iceberg" font througout for design consistency.
I used Javascript to make thumbnails with id seclectors and onclick event listener attitibutes for graphic, music, and video elements
that would reveal larger displays of themselves.
Because Github does not allow scrips and programs to be uploaded to and run on the back end of their servers (at least I believe so),
I used Repl.it to upload and run Python and C++ files I also completed for some programming classes.
